Headings: Use #s followed by a blank space for notebook titles and section headings:
# title
## major headings
### subheadings
#### 4th level subheadings

Emphasis: Use this code: Bold: __string__ or **string** Italic: _string_ or *string*

Monospace font: Surround text with a back single quotation mark. (`) Use monospace for file path and file names and for text users enter or message text users see.

Line breaks: Sometimes markdown doesnâ€™t make line breaks when you want them. Use 2 spaces or this code for a manual line break: <br>

Indented quoting: Use a greater than sign (>) and then a space, then type the text. The text is indented and has a gray horizontal line to the left of it until the next carriage return.

Bullets: Use the dash sign (- ) with a space after it, or a space, a dash, and a space ( - ), to create a circular bullet. To create a sub bullet, use a tab followed a dash and a space. You can also use an asterisk instead of a dash, and it works the same.

Numbered lists: Start with 1. followed by a space, then it starts numbering for you. Start each line with some number and a period, then a space. Tab to indent to get subnumbering.

Horizontal lines: Use three asterisks: ***
